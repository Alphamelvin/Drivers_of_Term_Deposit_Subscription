**# Drivers_of_Term_Deposit_Subscription**

**Dataset Description:**
This is a dashboard analysis identifying key factors influencing term deposit subscriptions using Power BI. This dataset originates from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The campaigns primarily involved telephone outreach, often requiring multiple calls to the same client to determine whether they would subscribe ("yes") or decline ("no") a term deposit product.

**Project Overview:**
This dashboard explores the key factors influencing whether customers subscribe to term deposits at the Portuguese banking institution. It leverages demographic, behavioral, and campaign-related data to help decision-makers understand what drives successful marketing outcomes. By visualizing the data interactively, it enables business leaders to target the right segments more effectively and optimize their campaign strategies.

**Dashboard Insights:**
The dashboard features real-time visuals showing how age, job type, education, loan status, and contact method relate to subscription success. With dynamic filters for age group, job, and campaign month, users can dive deep into patterns such as students and retirees having higher subscription rates, or cellular calls performing better than telephone outreach. Trends across months and days of the week help in timing campaigns for maximum impact.

**Purpose & Value:**
By making complex data easy to interpret, this dashboard empowers marketers, analysts, and bank executives to make informed, data-backed decisions. Instead of relying on guesswork, they can now focus efforts where the likelihood of success is highest, boosting efficiency, customer conversion, and overall ROI on marketing efforts. It‚Äôs a powerful example of how data storytelling can guide strategy in the finance sector.

### 1. Dashboard Overview

![Dashboard Overview](images/Term Deposit Subscriptions Dashboard.png)

The dashboard presents a clear picture of a community of 10,476 clients, with 3,000 already subscribed, representing an 11.3% subscription rate. The age group analysis highlights an inspiring trend, with individuals aged 60 and above, as well as those under 20, leading at over 40% each‚Äîperhaps retirees are planning for a comfortable retirement, while young ones, possibly with parental guidance, are beginning to save early. The 20-30 age group contributes around 20%, while the 31-60 range is slightly lower, indicating a need to engage this middle segment more actively. The job type breakdown further reflects the diversity, with students at the forefront at 19.2%, followed by retirees at 15.7%, blue-collar workers at 13%, unemployed individuals at 12%, and self-employed persons, housemaids, and others at 11% each, showing a wide representation of the society in this savings initiative.
The way people are contacted and their financial trustworthiness significantly influence subscription rates. The data reveals a strong preference for cellular contact at 15%, far surpassing telephone at 5%, which makes sense given how much we rely on our mobile phones. Financial stability also plays a role, with a 13% subscription rate among those with no default history compared to 6% for the unknown group, emphasizing the importance of trust in encouraging savings. Housing and loan status shows a balanced distribution, with "yes" at 15% and "no/unknown" around 10%, suggesting that owning a home or having loans does not drastically affect decisions, while campaign contacts provide a slight uplift, pointing to the benefit of personal outreach.
Timing is a crucial factor, as the subscription rate begins strongly in July at 60% but drops to 10% by May, with noticeable peaks on Fridays and Mondays. The variety in education levels indicates an opportunity to introduce tailored educational programs to boost participation. The dashboard encourages us to focus on mobile outreach, reward clients with a solid financial record, and launch campaigns at the right time to grow this 11.3% subscription rate into a thriving savings movement that connects with the Portuguese people across different ages, occupations, and life experiences.


This dashboard presents a comprehensive visual summary of key factors driving term deposit subscriptions. It highlights total clients, subscribers, and subscription rate (11.3%), while breaking down patterns by age, job, education, contact method, and campaign timing.

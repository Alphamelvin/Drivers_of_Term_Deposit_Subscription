**# Drivers_of_Term_Deposit_Subscription**

**Dataset Description:**
This is a dashboard analysis identifying key factors influencing term deposit subscriptions using Power BI. This dataset originates from direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The campaigns primarily involved telephone outreach, often requiring multiple calls to the same client to determine whether they would subscribe ("yes") or decline ("no") a term deposit product.

**Project Overview:**
This dashboard explores the key factors influencing whether customers subscribe to term deposits at the Portuguese banking institution. It leverages demographic, behavioral, and campaign-related data to help decision-makers understand what drives successful marketing outcomes. By visualizing the data interactively, it enables business leaders to target the right segments more effectively and optimize their campaign strategies.

**Dashboard Insights:**
The dashboard features real-time visuals showing how age, job type, education, loan status, and contact method relate to subscription success. With dynamic filters for age group, job, and campaign month, users can dive deep into patterns such as students and retirees having higher subscription rates, or cellular calls performing better than telephone outreach. Trends across months and days of the week help in timing campaigns for maximum impact.

**Purpose & Value:**
By making complex data easy to interpret, this dashboard empowers marketers, analysts, and bank executives to make informed, data-backed decisions. Instead of relying on guesswork, they can now focus efforts where the likelihood of success is highest, boosting efficiency, customer conversion, and overall ROI on marketing efforts. Itâ€™s a powerful example of how data storytelling can guide strategy in the finance sector.

### 1. Dashboard Overview

This dashboard provides a detailed visual exploration of factors influencing term deposit subscriptions among 10,476 clients, with 3,000 already subscribed, representing an 11.3% conversion rate. Notably, individuals aged 60+ and those under 20 have the highest subscription ratesâ€”each exceeding 40%â€”suggesting a blend of retirement planning and early financial education. The middle-age groups, especially 31â€“60, show lower engagement, presenting an opportunity for targeted campaigns. Job type data reveals that students, retirees, and blue-collar workers are most responsive, indicating diverse participation across societal roles. Cellular contact stands out as the most effective communication method, and financial trustworthinessâ€”measured by the absence of default historyâ€”correlates strongly with subscription success.

Education level, housing, and loan status show mixed influence, with no significant trend across those variables, though campaign contact does offer a slight boost in subscriptions. Seasonal and weekday trends are also critical: subscriptions peak in July and are stronger on Mondays and Fridays, suggesting strategic timing can improve outcomes. Overall, this dashboard suggests the need for data-driven outreachâ€”particularly via mobileâ€”combined with trust-building and timely engagement. By tailoring strategies to audience behavior and life stage, the bank can expand participation in term deposits and foster a culture of saving across all demographics.
